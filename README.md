# OSCR :smiley_cat:
I am constantly forgetting to order food for my senior cat Oscar resulting in last minute orders. The aim of this project is to automatically re-order food to prevent running out of cat food.

## Status 
Idea :thought_balloon:

## General
Automatic cat foot reordering @Medpets based on inventory. Realised through a USB scale or load cell connected to a mini pc like RPi (Zero) or Arduino. Software side:
- Python 
  - pyppeteer (Medpets has no API -> use headless Chrome?)
  - mailer (for notifications? "Running low...")
  - ...

## Ordering List (tbd)

| Item          | Amount        | Price |
| :------------- | :------------- | :----- |
| Pi Zero       | 1             | ??? € |
| Load Cell     | 1             | ??? € |
| ...           | ...           | ... |
